# Daily Python Learning Repository

This repository documents my journey of learning Python through a week-wise and exercise-wise learning plan.  
Each week contains multiple exercises, and I upload solutions one day at a time as I complete them.  
The goal of this repository is to build consistency and strong Python fundamentals through hands-on practice.

---

## 📌 Upload Pattern
- Exercises are grouped by **week folders** (Week1, Week2, Week3, etc.)
- Each exercise is saved as a separate Python file
- Some days I may upload **one file**, some days **two or more**, depending on the number of exercises in that week
- Every change is committed and pushed to GitHub so that progress is visible over time

### 🌱 Purpose of this Repository
This repository is not just a storage place for code —  
it is a **visible record of progress, discipline, and skill-building** as I continue to learn Python step-by-step.

More weeks will be added gradually with new concepts and more advanced exercises as learning continues.
