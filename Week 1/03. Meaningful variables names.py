# Naming Convention Exercise - 1

# Meaningful variables tell you what the variable represents​
first_name = "Venkatesh"      # this variable clearly represents a first name
last_name = "V"               # this variable clearly represents a last name

# rename the above variables
given_name = first_name       # assigning a new, meaningful name to the same value
family_name = last_name       # assigning a new name for the last name variable

# Choose appropriate names for variable and print the concatenated result
full_name = given_name + " " + family_name   # string concatenation with a space
print(full_name)                              # prints the full name to the console
